0,"Natural language interfaces to databases(NLIDB) democratize end user access to relational data. Due to fundamental differences between natural language communication and programming, it is common for end users to issue questions that are ambiguous to the system or fall outside the semantic scope of its underlying query language. We present PHOTON, a robust, modular, cross-domain NLIDB that can flag natural language input to which a SQL mapping cannot be immediately determined. PHOTON consists of a strong neural semantic parser (63.2 structure accuracy on the Spider dev benchmark), a human-in-the-loop question corrector, a SQL executor and a response generator. The question corrector isa discriminative neural sequence editor which detects confusion span(s) in the input question and suggests rephrasing until a translatable input is given by the user or a maximum number of iterations are conducted. Experiments on simulated data show that the proposed method effectively improves the robustness of text-to-SQL system against untranslatable user input.The live demo of our system is available at http://www.naturalsql.com",2,2,4,3,2.75,0.916666667,4,3,4,3,3.5,0.333333333,1,3,4,2,2.5,1.666666667,NLI Search,,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,TRUE,TRUE,TRUE,TRUE,FALSE,34.31,-0.630439281,3304.231558,102098.7713,0.032363088,0.596730585

Tabouid contains 10,000 (virtual) cards in English, and as many in French, covering not only words and linguistic expressions but also a variety of topics including artists, historical events or scientific concepts. Each card corresponds to a Wikipedia article, and conversely, any article could be turned into a card. A range of relatively simple NLP and machine-learning techniques are effectively integrated into a two-stage process. First, a large subset of Wikipedia articles are scored - this score estimates the difficulty, or alternatively, the playability of the page. Then, the best articles are turned into cards by selecting, for each of them, a list of banned words based on its content.

Notably, Xiaomingbot utilizes a voice cloning technology to synthesize the speech trained from a real person's voice data in one input language. The proposed system enjoys several merits: it has an animated avatar, and is able to generate and read multilingual news.

Revealing the use of such techniques can help promote media literacy and critical thinking, and eventually contribute to limiting the impact of ``fake news'' and disinformation campaigns. Prta (Propaganda Persuasion Techniques Analyzer) allows users to explore the articles crawled on a regular basis by highlighting the spans in which propaganda techniques occur and to compare them on the basis of their use of propaganda techniques.

Our toolkit comprises ten different models, and benchmarks them on naturally occurring misspellings from multiple sources. We find that many systems do not adequately leverage the context around the misspelt token. To remedy this, (i) we train neural models using spelling errors in context, synthetically constructed by reverse engineering isolated misspellings; and (ii) use richer representations of the context. By training on our synthetic examples, correction rates improve by 9 (absolute) compared to the case when models are trained on randomly sampled character perturbations. Using richer contextual representations boosts the correction rate by another 3.

51,"The proliferation of fake news and filter bubbles makes it increasingly difficult to form an unbiased, balanced opinion towards a topic. To ameliorate this, we propose 360 degree Stance Detection, a tool that aggregates news with multiple perspectives on a topic. It presents them on a spectrum ranging from support to opposition, enabling the user to base their opinion on multiple pieces of diverse evidence.",5,3,4,5,4.25,0.916666667,2,1,2,2,1.75,0.25,3,2,2,2,2.25,0.25,News Summary MultiPerspect,,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,29.13,-0.157224894,1168.609737,39434.88023,0.029633911,0.535470906
52,"Madly Ambiguous is an open source, online game aimed at teaching audiences of all ages about structural ambiguity and why it's hard for computers. After a brief introduction to structural ambiguity, users are challenged to complete a sentence in a way that tricks the computer into guessing an incorrect interpretation. Behind the scenes are two different NLP-based methods for classifying the user's input, one representative of classic rule-based approaches to disambiguation and the other representative of recent neural network approaches. Qualitative feedback from the system's use in online, classroom, and science museum settings indicates that it is engaging and successful in conveying the intended take home messages. A demo of Madly Ambiguous can be played at http://madlyambiguous.osu.edu.",4,3,4,4,3.75,0.25,2,3,4,2,2.75,0.916666667,2,1,4,1,2,2,Game Education CS,,TRUE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,19.93,-0.006068945,1215.925799,47798.25268,0.025438708,0.55207634
53,"Having an understanding of interpersonal relationships is helpful in many contexts. Our system seeks to assist humans with that task, using textual information (e.g., case notes, speech transcripts, posts, books) as input. Specifically, our system first extracts qualitative and quantitative information elements (which we call signals) about interactions among persons, aggregates those to provide a condensed view of relationships and then enables users to explore all facets of the resulting social (multi-)graph through a visual interface.",2,1,3,4,2.5,1.666666667,3,2,4,3,3,0.666666667,1,3,4,3,2.75,1.583333333,InformationExtraction Relationships,,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,36.09,-0.311071157,878.1311003,47262.38231,0.018579916,0.56318438
54,"This paper presents a web-based information system, RiskFinder, for facilitating the analyses of soft and hard information in financial reports. In particular, the system broadens the analyses from the word level to sentence level, which makes the system useful for practitioner communities and unprecedented among financial academics. The proposed system has four main components: 1) a Form 10-K risk-sentiment dataset, consisting of a set of risk-labeled financial sentences and pre-trained sentence embeddings; 2) metadata, including basic information on each company that published the Form 10-K financial report as well as several relevant financial measures; 3) an interface that highlights risk-related sentences in the financial reports based on the latest sentence embedding techniques; 4) a visualization of financial time-series data for a corresponding company. This paper also conducts some case studies to showcase that the system can be of great help in capturing valuable insight within large amounts of textual information. The system is now online available at https://cfda.csie.org/RiskFinder/.",3,1,3,3,2.5,1,4,2,4,4,3.5,1,5,4,3,3,3.75,0.916666667,Finance Risk Analysis Legal,,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,27.22,-0.327102184,3632.009616,41965.58855,0.086547329,0.611040572
